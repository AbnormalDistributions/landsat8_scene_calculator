* Landsat8 Scene Calculator
This is a fork of [[https://github.com/AbnormalDistributions/landsat8_scene_calculator][landsat8_scene_calculator]]. Which is modified to include CLI interface to download the bands/data files in addition to creating the Images.

** Introduction
This program can download the landsat8 images and other files from [[landsat-pds.s3.amazonaws.com][amazonaws]]. The 11 bands can be downloaded on demand depending upon which image you want to create. Or any files available for that scene can be downloaded.

This program can create GeoTIFF files of the following:
 - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
 - Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
 - Visible Spectrum (Natural Color)
 - Short Wave Infrared
 - Agriculture
 - Bathymetric

** Important Notes:
 - ./data/index.gz is index for available data, which is downloaded if not present, do not delete it. 
 - ./data/defaults.json is user's last input for prompts in the program, it's safe to delete it but you'll have to input the values to prompt. 
 - If download is interrupted because of any problems the program will exit, on the next run the downloaded file can resume download as long the incomplete '.part' file is not deleted. 

** Usage:
To use this program you need to know which scene you want to work on.
1. Find the scene you would like on [[https://search.remotepixel.ca][RemotePixel.ca]].
2. Note the [[https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/the-worldwide-reference-system/][WRS path and row number]] of the image (written inside blue circle at the center of each scene). Or the [[https://docs.opendata.aws/landsat-pds/readme.html][string of the scene]].

*** As Image creator
1. Run the 'main.py' script.
2. If you do not have the string, enter path number and row number and browse through available scenes data and choose one. (Or you can say yes to latest).
3. You'll get the details on the scene you just selected confirm it is what you wanted. It's also a good idea to remember or note the scene string you choose as it'll be easier to use in future. The scene string is in the index 'productId'.
4. After you chose the scene where you want to work on, choose the image you want to create, it'll automatically download any necessary bands for that image and create it. The downloaded bands and generated images will be saved in './data/PPPRRR/SCENE_STR/' directory where PPP and RRR are path and row numbers. 

See Resources for more information on the GeoTIFFs that are created.

*** As Data downloader
If you only want to download bands for creating Images it'll download those automatically. In case you want to download more data the do the followings.
1. Run the 'landsat8.py' script.
2. Enter the scene string or WRS path and row like in Image Creator.
3. You'll get the details on the scene you just selected confirm it is what you wanted.
4. It'll give you list of available files, choose the file you want to download.

** Future Features
I plan to add following features in future:
1. Command line arguments using argparse. All the inputs that can be given through prompts will be available through command line arguments.
2. Automation of script, by using the defaults.json the user will be able to automate what he did in his last session. Or even make a script like file to download large number of files. 


* Scene Locator
The following site gives you the available scenes in WRS coordinate, the numbers on top of any box is in path/row format. The scene string can also be found out if you look at the URL of the image shown on the right when you click at a scene. But since you can search for all scenes for that WRS path/row interactively it's not necessary to do that. But having the string makes things easier.
